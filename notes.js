// operators
// - modulus (%)
// - typeof
        console.log(typeof 4.5)
        // → number
        console.log(typeof "x")
        // → string

// The other operators shown all operated on two values, but typeof takes only one. Operators that use two values are called binary operators, while those that take one are called unary operators. The minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator.

        console.log(- (10 - 2))
        // → -8


// There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN (“not a number”).

    console.log(NaN == NaN)
    // → false
