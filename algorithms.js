    // There is a structure to the topics that you can learn that will greatly improve your understanding if you progress through the algorithms. Here are the steps I suggest you follow:

        // Learn to evaluate efficiency (complexity) of algorithms
        // Develop a process for problem solving
        // Learn basic algorithm patterns
        // Learn basic data structures
        // Put into practice
        // Start easy and progress harder
        // Track and measure
